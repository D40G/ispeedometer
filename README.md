Hologram Speed Script edited for RP server (fuel ui and fixed problems with ui)

Modification of <a href="https://github.com/kasuganosoras/hologramspeed">HologramSpeed</a>, code was rewriting by <a href="https://github.com/s1nyx">Sinyx</a> due to
bugs where the nui was disappearing and added an NUI for fuel (it's adapted for LegacyFuel but can be change easily in the config.)
