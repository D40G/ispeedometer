Hologram Speed Script edited for RP server (fuel ui and fixed problems with ui)


Modification of <a href="https://github.com/kasuganosoras/hologramspeed">HologramSpeed</a>, code was rewrite by <a href="https://github.com/s1nyx">Sinyx</a> due to 
bugs where the nui was disapparing and added a NUI for fuel (it's adapted for LegacyFuel but can be change easily in the config)
